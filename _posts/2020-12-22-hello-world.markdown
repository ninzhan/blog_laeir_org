Hello World
I say this every time I start a new programming language. Its so ingraned in the culture that it feels weird to do anything technical without saying it. So, Hello World!

That being said, I now have a way to make blog posts and be able to have more granular control over them. I hope you understand the struggles of wysiwyg editors. Jekyll makes things so much easier to customize and work with and I haven't even done anything intense with it yet. I plan to get the blog theme updated and to get some analytics going. But for the time being, I have a place where I can put words to the page.

While this is my first post, it is also my going dark post as I will not be available until around December 28th, when you should see updates both here and to the website as a whole. I'll have better links and meta data as well.

I will also have good news for the people who follow my SCP T-Shirts as well. I'm working on getting a better provider for the t-shirts, and making the shop link for Facebook look a lot better. 

This will be the primary way for me to submit musings on my current work and the topics surrounding them. I'll try to keep it somewhat relevant and will be able to answer questions. I'll get a form ready later, but if you want to ask me a question right now, email me below.
